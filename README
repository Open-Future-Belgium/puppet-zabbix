zabbix

This is the zabbix module.

It uses https://github.com/vadv/zabbixapi to talk to the JSONRpc API presented by Zabbix, but I am going to change that soon.

It is currently only partially featured - it will install a zabbix server on EL, create hosts and hostgroups.

The Zabbix API is, I apologise for this, not awesome.
